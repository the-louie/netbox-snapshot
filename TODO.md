# TODO

Outstanding work to deliver the NetBox portable-snapshot tool
(`nbsnap`). The phasing comes from `PLAN.md`. Every open entry is sized
for a 1, 2 hour focused work window. Each entry includes the file or
area it touches, the technical context the implementer needs, the
requirements as a concrete change list, and a testing step. Closed
items move to the Completed section at the end.

ID conventions:

* `INFRA-nn` for repo, CI, dev environment, test stack work.
* `RES-nn` for research and decision tickets that gate downstream
  implementation.
* `FEAT-nn` for feature implementation.
* `TEST-nn` for testing work that is not a side effect of a `FEAT-`.
* `DOC-nn` for documentation deliverables.
* `BUG-nn` for bug fixes.
* `REL-nn` for release and milestone gates.

Sub-tickets carry a lowercase letter suffix on the parent ID, for
example `INFRA-01a`, so a cross-reference from `PLAN.md` to the parent
concept still resolves.

Cross-references:

* `PLAN.md` for phase definitions and exit criteria.
* `docs/` for design documents.
* `docs/frictions/` for friction-area deep-dives.
* `goals.md` for scope and success criteria.

## Codebase status

Phases 0 through 9 are implemented and committed. The open backlog
is empty as of this audit; the rescue-loop skill (see
`/workspace/.claude/skills/rescue-loop/SKILL.md`) is the supported
way to surface new tickets from a fresh `nbsnap import` log
against the lab destination.

Run `git log --oneline --grep="^feat\|^fix\|^refactor\|^test\|^docs"`
for the full implementation history.

## Open

(empty)

## Future considerations

(none — see git history for the full implementation log)

## Completed

Per the audit on 2026-06-16, every ticket whose code has shipped
has been removed from the open backlog. Git history is the
authoritative implementation record. `git log --oneline TODO.md`
shows the audit commit and every prior body update; the matching
feat/fix/test/refactor/docs commits in `src/`, `tests/`, and
`docs/` carry the implementation detail per ticket.
